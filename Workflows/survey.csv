Female,28,46082,No,Positive ,"The bff challenge has changed my walking behaviour because now there are much more incentive to travel more on foot, be it because of the monetary value attached to the different tiers (1/2/3) that the individual hit upon successfully completing what was required, or simply because I wanted to try this new initiative with both my fanily member and my best of friends.  /  / At the end of the day, I managed to stay committed to hitting the Tier 3 of the HPB bff challenge, and even took it a 'step' further by signing up for a secondary challenge know as the LTW' Lose to Win Programme on the same day of registration at HPB Singapore (SGH) itself when I went to collect the step tracker. I managed to successfully lose 2kg (from 80kg - 78kg), and again won myself the incentive to keep fit as the days past thanks to this little device and the great feeling of making a small difference each day. (I even cleared my IPPT because each night I do abit of jogging) /  / Since that day of collection, I've decided that why not give each day a chance to do something healthy while I'm out and about. Whenever I'm outside I do an extra bit of walking around, stopping one bus stop earlier to walk abit was an interesting way of getting to know my surroundings better, and many funny ways to clock more steps to hit a conistent 10k steps as best as I can.  /  / The only thing us wearers of the Step Tracker is really to ensure that the device is charged (went of once walking for half an hour only to realise that there was no battery) / dont ever leave them at home when we go to work or out for a jog / and most certainly keep it in good condition.  /  / Overall, I find this an enriching experience because it has encouraged me to literally go the extra distance to walk up and down the steps as I travel to and fro places in our lovely Singapore. I'm an Avid Runner and have brought along this pair of lasting watch (remember to charge 10mins, once a week) for the previous few marathons I've took part in (i.e. recent 50 hours non stop run at bedok reservoir, 43km / railway run from bukit timah to tanjong pagar rail station, 10km / my photography trip, etc).  /  / I DO HOPE I CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS LTA-HPB-NUS Walking Study / Research and if I may, would like to really sign myself up to see if I can see to making this more beneficial to the rest of those around me. /  / Keeping Healthy is a choice we must all make, be it with or without incentive (of course now with this, we should not have any other reason not to. Heh) /  / - Terence (I'm also quite happy cause I registered the moment the news came out, even got my steptracker for free because i registered super early for this)"
